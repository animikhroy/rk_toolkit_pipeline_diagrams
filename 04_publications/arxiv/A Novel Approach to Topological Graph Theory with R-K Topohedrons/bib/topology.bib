Title={Convergence between Categorical Representations of Reeb Space and Mapper},
Year={2016},
Journal={arXiv},
Pages={20},
Abstract={The Reeb space, which generalizes the notion of a Reeb graph, is one of the few
tools in topological data analysis and visualization suitable for the study of multivariate scientific datasets. First introduced by Edelsbrunner et al., it compresses the compo-
nents of the level sets of a multivariate mapping and obtains a summary representation

of their relationships. A related construction called mapper, and a special case of the
mapper construction called the Joint Contour Net have been shown to be effective in
visual analytics. Mapper and JCN are intuitively regarded as discrete approximations
of the Reeb space, however without formal proofs or approximation guarantees. An
open question has been proposed by Dey et al. as to whether the mapper construction
converges to the Reeb space in the limit.
In this paper, we are interested in developing the theoretical understanding of the
relationship between the Reeb space and its discrete approximations to support its use
in practical data analysis. Using tools from category theory, we formally prove the
convergence between the Reeb space and mapper in terms of an interleaving distance
between their categorical representations. Given a sequence of refined discretizations,
we prove that these approximations converge to the Reeb space in the interleaving
distance; this also helps to quantify the approximation quality of the discretization at
a fixed resolution.},

Absract={We propose an algorithm for surface reconstruction from unorganized points base on a view of the sampling process as a deformation from the original surface. In the course of this deformation the Medial Scaffold (MS) — a graph representation of the 3D Medial Axis (MA) — of the original surface undergoes abrupt topological changes (transitions) such that the MS of the unorganized point set is significantly different from that of the original surface. The algorithm seeks a sequence of transformations of the MS to invert this process. Specifically, some MS curves (junctions of 3 MA sheets) correspond to triplets of points on the surface and represent candidates for generating a (Delaunay) triangle to mesh that portion of the surface. We devise a greedy algorithm that iteratively transforms the MS by “removing” suitable candidate MS curves (gap transform) from a rank-ordered list sorted by a combination of properties of the MS curve and its neighborhood context.

This approach is general and applicable to surfaces which are: non-closed (with boundaries), non-orientable, non-uniformly sampled, non-manifold (with self-intersections), nonsmooth (with sharp features: seams, ridges). In addition, the method is comparable in speed
and complexity to current popular Voronoi/Delaunay-based algorithms, and is applicable
to very large datasets.}

Abstract={In this study we concentrate on qualitative topological analysis of the local behavior of the space of natural images. To this end, we use a space of 3 by 3 high-contrast patchesMstudied by Mumford et al. We develop a theoretical model for the high-density 2-dimensional submanifold ofMshowing that it has the topology of the Klein bottle. Using our topological software package PLEX we experimentally verify our theoretical conclusions. We use polynomial representation to give coordinatization to various subspaces of M. We and the bestting embedding of the Klein bottle into the ambient space of M. Our results are currently being used in developing a compression algorithm based on a Klein bottle dictionary.},

Abstract={In this text several concepts of topology, such as neighborhoods, transition t he open kernel etc., are integrated under one common relational roof. Transitions between them are made possible, not least via TituRel programs.
Furthermore, a study of several approaches to spatial reasoning on discreteness, proximity, nearness, apartness is presented, which are frequently performed by logicians. Also some ideas about how to work relationally on simplicial complexes are demonstrated at least in examples

Abstract={We develop a tighter implementation of basic PL topology, which keeps track of some combinatorial structure beyond PL homeomorphism type. With this technique we clarify some aspects of PL transversality and give combinatorial proofs of a number of known results. 
New results include a combinatorial characterization of collapsible polyhedra in terms of constructible posets (generalizing face posets of constructible simplicial complexes in the sense of Hochster). The relevant constructible posets are also characterized in terms of Reading's zipping of posets, which is a variation of edge contractions in simplicial complexes.}

Abstract={The paper surveys some new results and open problems connected with such fundamental combinatorial concepts as polytopes, simplicial complexes, cubical complexes, and subspace arrangements. Particular attention is paid to the case of simplicial and cubical subdivisions of manifolds and, especially, spheres. We describe important constructions which allow to study all these combinatorial objects by means of methods of commutative and homological algebra. The proposed approach to combinatorial problems relies on the theory of moment-angle complexes, currently being developed by the authors. The theory centres around the construction that assigns to each simplicial complex K with m vertices a  with a special bigraded cellular decomposition. In the framework of this theory, the well-known non-singular toric varieties arise as orbit spaces of maximally free actions of subtori on moment-angle complexes corresponding to simplicial spheres. We express different invariants of simplicial complexes and related combinatorial-geometrical objects in terms of the bigraded cohomology rings of the corresponding moment-angle complexes. Finally, we show that the new relationships between combinatorics, geometry and topology result in solutions to some well-known topological problems.}
