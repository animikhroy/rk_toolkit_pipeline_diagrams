Abstract={The interconnected nature of graphs often results in difficult to interpret clutter. Typically techniques focus on either decluttering by clustering nodes with similar properties or grouping edges with similar relationship. We propose using mapper, a powerful topological data analysis tool, to summarize the structure of a graph in a way that both clusters data with similar properties and preserves relationships. Typically, mapper operates on a given data by utilizing a scalar function defined on every point in the data
and a cover for scalar function codomain. The output of mapper is a graph that summarize the shape of the space. In this paper, we outline how to use this mapper construction on an input graphs, outline three filter functions that capture important structures of
the input graph, and provide an interface for interactively modifying the cover. To validate our approach, we conduct several case studies on synthetic and real world data sets and demonstrate how our method can give meaningful summaries for graphs with various complexities},

Abstract={Mapper is an algorithm for describing high-dimensional datasets in terms of simple geometric objects. We give a new definition of Mapper, with which we are able to prove that Mapper is a functor and that Mapper is a homotopy equivalence for certain “nice” input data. To establish these results we describe the statistical theory of functorial clustering and the topological machinery of homotopy colimits. At the end of the document we show, by means of numerical experiments, that the functoriality of Mapper is useful
in applications.},

Abstract={The Reeb space, which generalizes the notion of a Reeb graph, is one of the few
tools in topological data analysis and visualization suitable for the study of multivariate scientific datasets. First introduced by Edelsbrunner et al., it compresses the compo-
nents of the level sets of a multivariate mapping and obtains a summary representation of their relationships. A related construction called mapper, and a special case of the
mapper construction called the Joint Contour Net have been shown to be effective in
visual analytics. Mapper and JCN are intuitively regarded as discrete approximations
of the Reeb space, however without formal proofs or approximation guarantees. An
open question has been proposed by Dey et al. as to whether the mapper construction
converges to the Reeb space in the limit.
In this paper, we are interested in developing the theoretical understanding of the
relationship between the Reeb space and its discrete approximations to support its use
in practical data analysis. Using tools from category theory, we formally prove the
convergence between the Reeb space and mapper in terms of an interleaving distance
between their categorical representations. Given a sequence of refined discretizations,
we prove that these approximations converge to the Reeb space in the interleaving
distance; this also helps to quantify the approximation quality of the discretization at
a fixed resolution.},

Abstract={In this article, we study the question of the statistical convergence of the 1-dimensional Mapper to its continuous analogue, the Reeb graph. We show that the Mapper is an optimal estimator of the Reeb graph, which gives, as a byproduct, a method to automatically tune its parameters and compute confidence regions on its topological features, such as its loops and flares. This allows to circumvent the issue of testing a large grid of parameters and keeping the most stable ones in the brute-force setting, which is widely used in visualization, clustering and feature selection with the Mapper.},
