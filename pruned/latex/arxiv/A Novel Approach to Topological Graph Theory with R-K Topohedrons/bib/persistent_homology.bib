abstract="We show that the persistent homology of a filtered d-dimensionalsimplicial complex is simply the standard homology of a particular graded module over a polynomial ring.Our analysis establishes the existence of a simple description ofpersistent homology groups over arbitrary fields.It also enables us to derive a naturalalgorithm for computing persistent homology of spaces in arbitrary dimension over any field.This result generalizes and extends the previously knownalgorithm that was restricted to subcomplexes of S3 andZ2 coefficients.Finally, our study implies the lack of a simple classification over non-fields.Instead, we give an algorithm for computing individualpersistent homology groups over an arbitrary principal ideal domain in any dimension.",

Abstract={Persistent homology is a recent grandchild of homology that has found use in
science and engineering as well as in mathematics. This paper surveys the method as well
as the applications, neglecting completeness in favor of highlighting ideas and directions.},

Abstract={This article surveys recent work of Carlsson and collaborators on
applications of computational algebraic topology to problems of feature detection and shape recognition in high-dimensional data. The primary mathematical tool considered is a homology theory for point-cloud data sets —
persistent homology — and a novel representation of this algebraic characterization — barcodes. We sketch an application of these techniques to the
classification of natural images.
