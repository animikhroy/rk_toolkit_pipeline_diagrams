Abstract={Matter in the universe is organised in a hierarchical structure. At the bottom we have elementary particles: quarks, gluons, electrons etc. At present we don’t know what these particles are made off. But we believe we know that quarks, gluons etc. make up protons, neutrons, etc. These then go together to make atoms, that are the building blocks of molecules. Atoms and molecules gives us gas, liquids and solids from which we get stars and planets which are grouped together in galaxies, that then form clusters and eventually we arrive at the entire universe. Or from atoms and molecules we get macro molecules like proteins and DNA, that are the building blocks of organelles, which together form the cells.

From cells we get organs, that put together form organisms: animals and plants of a great
variety of species. The totality of individuals and species constitute the entire ecology}

Title={Topological Quantum Phase Transition and 3D Texture Inversion in a Tunable Topological Insulator},
Year={2011},
Author={Hasan et. al},
Journal={arXiv},
Abstract={The recently discovered three dimensional or bulk topological insulators are expected to exhibit exotic quantum phenomena. It is believed that a trivial insulator can be twisted into a topological state by modulating the spin-orbit interaction or the crystal lattice via odd number of band inversions, driving the system through a topological quantum phase transition. By directly measuring the topological invariants (for method to directly measure ν0 of Fu-Kane, see Hsieh et.al., Science 323, 919 (2009) at http://www.sciencemag.org/content/323/5916/919.abstract)

we report the observation of a topological phase transition in a tunable spin-orbit system BiTl (which is an analog of the most stud- ied topological insulator Bi2Se3, see Xia et.al., Nature Phys. 5, 398 (2009) at http://www.nature.com/nphys/journal/v5/n6/full/nphys1294.html and spin-momentum locked topological-order at Hsieh et.al., Nature 460, 1101 (2009)) where the topological insulator formation process is visualized for the first time.
In the topological state, vortex-like polarization states are observed to exhibit 3D vectorial textures, which collectively feature a chirality transition of its topological spin-textures as the spin-momentum locked (topologically ordered) electrons on the surface g  through the zero carrier density point. Such phase transition and texture chirality inversion can be the physical basis for observing fractional charge and other related fractional topological phenomena.}

Abstract={Previously, we have seen that the breaking of a continuous symmetry is accompanied by the appearance of massless Goldstone modes. Fluctuations of the latter lead to the destruction of long-range order at any finite temperature in dimensions d ≤ 2 — the Mermin-Wagner theorem. However, our perturbative analysis revealed only a power-law decay of spatial correlations in precisely two-dimensions — “quasi long-range order”. Such cases admit the existence of a new type of continuous phase transition driven by the proliferation of topological defects. The aim of this section is to discuss the phenomenology of this type of transition which lies outside the usual classification scheme.}

Abstract={Does a semiclassical particle remember the phase space topology?
We discuss this question in the context of the Berezin-Toeplitz quantization and quantum measurement theory by using tools of topological data analysis. One of its facets involves a calculus of Toeplitz operators with piecewis constant symbol developed in an appendixby Laurent Charles.}
