Abstract={We discuss how recently discovered techniques and tools from compressed sensingcan be used in tensor decompositions, with a view towards modeling signals from multiple arrays of multiple sensors. We show that with appropriate bounds on a measure of separation between radiating sources called coherence, one could always guarantee the existence and uniqueness of a best rank-r approximation of the tensor representing the signal. We also deduce a computationally feasible variant of Kruskalâ€™s uniqueness condition, where thecoherence appears as a proxy for k-rank. Problems of sparsest recovery with an infinite continuous dictionary, lowest-rank tensor representation, and blind source separation are treated in a uniform fashion. The decomposition of the measurement tensor leads to simultaneous localization and extraction of radiating sources, in an entirely deterministic manner},
