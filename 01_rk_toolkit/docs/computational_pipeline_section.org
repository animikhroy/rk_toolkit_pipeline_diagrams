#+TITLE: Computational Pipeline Section

* Introduction

An RK-Pipeline, is the process of moving between an NxM Tensor into
an RK-Model and visualized as an RK-Diagram. The benefits of an RK-Model over
traditional models are numerous, including the fact that an RK-Model is a
compact representation that perserves topology and encodes structure in high
dimensional data. The following section will focus on the RK Toolkit library
and go through the various transformation steps from an NxM Tensor into a
visualized RK-Diagram. This novel approach toward topological data analysis
is extendable through the SDK hosted on github.com/andorsk/rk_toolkit. Examples
of how to use the toolkit are also hosted there.

There are a few novel concepts and objects within the pipeline as well as
the entire pipeline itself, by virtue of it's components and ordering, that
provide a new and novel approach toward topological data analysis.

* RK Pipeline

An RK-Pipeline is a unidirectonal pipeline that builds an RK-Model from a
incoming dataset.

Figure 1 shows a diagram with the RK-Pipeline specified

Composed together are the following steps:

1. Preprocess Steps
2. Localization Algorithm
3. Hierarchical Feature Extraction Nodes
4. Filter Functions
5. Linkage Functions

Composed together, these component synethesize an RK-Model. An RK-Model
is described in the models section below

** Models

The following concepts are introduced in the RK-Pipeline

*** RK-Model:
An RK-Model is a composite datastructure that looks like below:
![../imgs/rk-model.png](../imgs/rk-model.png)
*** Graph Node Mask:
A graph mask is a masking object against nodes in a graph. When
an element of a mask is True, the node is masked and hidden in the
corresponding graph. When the element is False, the node is not hidden.
Computing these masks are useful for restricting a set into a subset.
*** Heirarchical Feature Graph
A hierarchical feature graph is an explicit graph where features are
arranged in an hierarchical fashion to "concepts". As an example,
if you weigh multiple mass measures, they would be all under a
"mass" parent. Similarly, other measures can be associated together
to create parent data structures.

Currently only supported in single level structures, however there
is room for research on multi-level structures
*** RK-Diagram
An RK-Digram is a visualization of an RK-Model. It contains properties
related to visualization and aesthetics that are not contained in the core
RK-Model

*** Graph Filter Function
A filter function is a function that takes in a node and filters
based upon a set of contraints

*** RK-Pipeline:
An RK-Pipeline is the composition of multiple steps to form an RK-Model

* Preprocess Steps

We denote the proprocess step as $preprocess(x)$ where $preprocess$ is a
transformation function that can do n operations to X, serially, to manipulate
the original data into something more consumable. An example would be a qtransform
against frequency data, to give a multi-dimensional view of 1D data.

The preprocess step is the probably the most familiar step to most ML pipelines
within an RK-Pipeline. There is nothing novel about this preprocess step when
related to other RK-Pipelines, aside from fact that it is part of the pipeline,
and should be a specified component (even it is a passthrough component)

For some analysis such as LIGO analysis from <paper>, this preprocess step is
critical.

* Localization Algorithm

The localization algorithm takes in an NxM tensor and localizes it to some
global space. This is important when looking at RK-Models in conjunction with
eachother. It could be driven by temporal, spatial, or other concerns.

It's process is forked from the original pipeline, and does not impact
the rest of the pipeline. It's only use is to localize a model in a global
setting, to give better contextual ability to the model and allow for easier
comparisions.

In the case where there is no ability to localize models, models will
be placed in index in n dimensions.

* Hierarchical Feature Extraction

Following the preprocess steps, an NxM tensor is generated, which now must go through
the HFE pipeline.

** NxM tensor -> HFE(X)
where HFE creates an Heirarchical Feature Graph

* Graph Filter Functions
A filter function is a function that takes in a node and filters
based upon a set of contraints

* Linkage Functions

* RK-Models
An RK-Model is a composite datastructure build from an RK-Pipeline.

* RK-Diagrams
An RK-Digram is a visualization of an RK-Model. It contains properties
related to visualization and aesthetics that are not contained in the core
RK-Model.

* RK Toolkit
Hosted on github.com and can be extended.

An example of building a pipeline is below

   H = HeirarchicalExtractionPipeline()

   example_pipeline = RKPipeline(preprocess_nodes=[MinMaxNormalizerNode()],
                                 localization_algorithm=MaxLocalizer(),
                                 hierarchical_embedding_nodes= H,
                                 filter_functions=[
                                      {
                                          "HFeatureExtractor1" :
                                          {
                                              'range_measure': StaticFilter(min=.2, max=.8),
                                              'max_measure': StaticFilter(min=0, max=1)
                                          }
                                       }
                                  ], # question: how to define which limits for which measure. Each filter and linkage has to be BY CLUSTER
                                  linkage_function=SimpleLinkage(threshold=.8))

                                  example_pipeline.build()
    example_pipeline.fit(X)
    rk_model = example_pipeline.transform(X)
    rk_models.append(rk_model)

    visualizer = RKModelVisualizer(method="circular")
    visualizer.build(rk_models) # build requires a list of rk_models
