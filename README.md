### 01_rk_toolkit

A generalized implementation of the  [A Novel Approach to Topological Graph Theory with R-K Diagrams and Gravitational Wave Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06923) written by Andor Kesselman  and Animikh Roy. It's essentially a utility
package ( like sklearn ) specifically meant to support transfroms and objects in
the RKPipeline.

### 02_notebooks

Implementation of notebooks used in the paper. Specifically, two notebooks.

* Tableau Sales TDA w/ RK Diagrams
* Ligo PBH Classification 

### 03_rk-visualizer

RK Visualizer is a tool that was made as a prototype to demonstrate the RK
Diagrams. It does not use any of the core toolkit features, as was made as a
seperate initiative.


### 04_publications 

Publication documents for arxiv and peer review.
